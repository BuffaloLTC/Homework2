# Homework 2 Instructions

Homework 2 covers the following chapters in Chris Pine's
[Learn to Program](http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/):

- [More About Methods](http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/?Chapter=05)
- [Flow Control](http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/?Chapter=06)

For practice, first try the _A Few Things to Try_ sections of each chapter that
weren't covered during class. Then...

## For Homework 2:
* Create your own version of the Few Things to Try.
* Push it to a repo on your own github account
* Share the link in the group's Wiki for [homework 2](https://github.com/BuffaloLTC/Homework2/wiki/Homework-2-Links).


## How to initialize your homework repository:

First create the directory that you will be working in:
In terminal:
* `cd Desktop` Change directory to your desktop
* `mkdir TestyTest` Make a new directory
* `cd TestyTest` Change directory to that newly created directory
* `touch testy.rb` Create a file
* Open and modify file
* Save file

Next you'll need to create the repository:
On github:
* Click "Create a new repo" (It's next to your user name at the top of the screen)
* Input information about your project
* Copy link provided

In terminal:
* `git init` Initialize the repo
* `git status` check the status of the repo
* `git add -p` add the file changes
* `git status` we do it again to make sure all of the files we wanted were added
* `git commit -m "Initial Commit"` Make the first commit
* `git remote add origin *Paste Link Here*` add the remote for github
* Input your github credentials
* `git push origin master` push your commit to github
* `git status` make sure that there is nothing that we missed
